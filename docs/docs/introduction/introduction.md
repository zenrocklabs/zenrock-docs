# Zenrock Comprehensive Litepaper

*Decentralized Custody, Privacy and More — 2.3.2026*

**Zenrock is on a mission to expand and grow what is possible onchain with products and services users actually want. Our technology stack and deep cryptographic and cross-chain expertise allow us to venture into areas previously untapped.**

**$ROCK is the value capture mechanism for the Zenrock ecosystem, including all products developed by Zenrock Labs or by third parties leveraging Zenrock's infrastructure.**

## Overview

* **Zenrock:** A permissionless ecosystem supported by Zenrock Labs and the Zenrock Foundation.
* **zrChain:** A purpose-built Layer 1 for distributed multi-party computation (dMPC). It is flexible infrastructure powering everything in the Zenrock ecosystem

* **Decentralized Custody Tokens (DCTs):** Cross-chain assets secured by dMPC, eliminating centralized vaults and single points of failure. The first two DCTs, zenBTC and zenZEC, are live on Solana

* **Hush Protocol:** A Zcash inspired privacy layer on Solana. Shield assets, transfer privately, earn yield, and withdraw anywhere without exposing your wallets

* **Future Products:** dMPC unlocks use cases across DeFi, privacy, identity, key management, and beyond. Zenrock enables the development of products and services that solve real problems in DeFi and cloud

* **$ROCK benefits from ecosystem growth:** Every product built on zrChain, by Zenrock Labs or anyone else, flows revenue through the same tokenomics. More products, more fees, more value to $ROCK

# What's Next

zrChain is live. zenBTC is minting. Hush is shielding.

Custody and privacy are just the beginning. As Zenrock Labs and external teams ship more products, all of it feeds the same tokenomics.

## Near-Term Focus Areas

### Expanded DCT Ecosystem

Additional assets beyond BTC and ZEC, bringing more cross-chain liquidity with institutional-grade security.

The [DCT framework](./DCT/dct-introduction.md) is designed for extensibility---any asset can be brought to Solana through the same decentralized custody infrastructure.

### Hush Applications

DeFi primitives built on the shielded compute layer:

- Private lending protocols
- Confidential trading
- Anonymous payment rails

See [Hush Protocol](./Hush/hush-introduction.md) for the privacy layer architecture.

### Developer Tooling

Infrastructure to accelerate third-party building:

- SDKs and APIs
- Documentation and examples
- Integration templates

Builders interested in getting started should review [Build on zrChain](./build/overview.md).

### Protocol Upgrades

Continued expansion of security guarantees:

- dMPC operator set expansion (8 to 16 to 32 operators)
- Increased cryptographic thresholds
- Enhanced cross-chain observation

## The Vision

**More products. More fees. More value to $ROCK.**

Every product built on Zenrock infrastructure contributes to the same tokenomic model. As the ecosystem grows, protocol revenue grows, and [staking rewards](./rock-token/staking.md) increase accordingly.

Expect continued shipping.

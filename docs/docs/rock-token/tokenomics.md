# Zenrock's Tokenomic Design

![Zenrock Tokenomics Flow](/img/litepaper/zenrock%20tokenomics%20flow%20chart%201.png)

**Every fee from every product built on Zenrock's infrastructure, whether developed by Zenrock Labs or any other team, is handled according to the same tokenomic framework.** Fees earned are distributed as follows:

* **35% to Zenrock Labs:** operations, development, and $ROCK accumulation
* **30% to Node Reward Pool (NRP):** validators and stakers (distributed over 36 months per the below schedule)
* **30% to Application Builder:** developer of the product
  * This can be taken by the builder or otherwise directed at their discretion
  * In instances where Zenrock Labs develops the product generating the fee, it is also counted as the application builder
  * On zenBTC (though developed by Zenrock Labs) the application builder share is converted to yield on zenBTC
* **5% to zenBTC:** direct allocation to yield on zenBTC

**The key insight:** it doesn't matter *what* gets built on zrChain. Custody products, privacy products, identity products, things we haven't thought of yet. They all feed the same tokenomics. **More products = more fees = more demand for $ROCK.**

As a permissionless chain there is no obligation or expectation that every application builder will follow Zenrock Labs and choose to funnel 100% of its offchain revenue to Zenrock's tokenomics top of funnel. However, DAO / Foundation level support may be enhanced for those who decide to pursue this path.

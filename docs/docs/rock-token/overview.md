# $ROCK Token

$ROCK is the native token of zrChain and the value capture mechanism for all products developed by Zenrock or developed by third parties leveraging Zenrock's infrastructure.

## Token Specifications

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Total Supply | 1,000,000,000 ROCK |
| Inflation | None, ever |
| Native Chains | Cosmos (ICS-20), Solana (zenTP bridge) |
| Solana Contract Address | `5VsPJ2EG7jjo3k2LPzQVriENKKQkNUTzujEzuaj4Aisf` |

$ROCK has a fixed supply of 1 billion tokens with no inflation mechanism. All rewards and incentives come from pre-allocated pools established at genesis. There is no mechanism to mint new tokens.

## Utility

$ROCK serves as gas, governance, and the economic foundation of zrChain:

- **Gas**: All zrChain transactions require $ROCK for fees
- **Governance**: Token holders participate in protocol governance
- **Staking**: Secure the network by staking $ROCK with validators
- **Economic Foundation**: All ecosystem fees are paid in $ROCK (though often abstracted from the user)

## Economic Model

Unlike most tokens, $ROCK had economic utility immediately at TGE. Every revenue line across the Zenrock ecosystem, both onchain and offchain, flows through the token.

**Protocol-Driven Demand**: As fees increase, protocol-driven demand for $ROCK increases. This creates a direct, protocol-driven bid on $ROCK.

**Universal Fee Framework**: It does not matter what gets built on zrChain. Custody products, privacy products, identity products, and applications not yet conceived all feed the same tokenomics. More products equals more fees equals more buying pressure on $ROCK.

**Structural Token Sink**: Tokens distributed through the Node Reward Pool are returned to circulating supply slowly over time due to the 36-month vesting schedule, creating a structural supply constraint.

## Value Capture

All Zenrock products share one thing: $ROCK is the main value capture mechanism.

- **zenBTC**: Decentralized yield-bearing wrapped Bitcoin
- **zenZEC**: Decentralized wrapped Zcash
- **Hush Protocol**: Privacy layer for Solana
- **Future Products**: dMPC unlocks use cases across DeFi, privacy, identity, key management, and beyond

Every product built on zrChain, whether by Zenrock Labs or third-party developers, flows revenue through the same tokenomics framework.

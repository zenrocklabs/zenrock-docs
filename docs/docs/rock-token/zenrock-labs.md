# The Role of Zenrock Labs

Crypto loves the slogan **"all value accrues to the token."** In practice, that is usually fiction.

Real protocols need a real operating company to:

- Build product and ship integrations
- Support partners and run audits
- Handle compliance and grow awareness
- Help third-party builders deploy
- Maintain core infrastructure

That's Zenrock Labs. And all of this costs money.

## Why Labs Alignment Matters

Projects that underfund their Labs end up with stalled development, missed partnerships, and slow ecosystem growth. The token holder suffers.

**A well-resourced Labs means more products, faster growth, stronger partnerships, and a more valuable network.**

But here is the problem: very often Labs has no direct way to participate in the protocol's success---they are completely cut out of the tokenomic model. So invariably they find other ways to make money. Offchain deals, backdoor arrangements, quiet revenue streams that never touch the token.

**Zenrock does not operate that way.** We see transparency as a structural advantage. Instead of backroom deals that benefit Labs while the token flatlines, we built alignment into the protocol itself with a simple transparent revenue share that aligns and benefits all parties.

## The 35% Fee Share

**Zenrock Labs receives 35% of all protocol fees, permanently enshrined in the protocol.**

This is not a tax on the protocol---it is an investment in everything that makes the protocol worth owning. This fee share allows Zenrock Labs to direct all offchain revenue through the tokenomics top of funnel, creating 100% alignment between Labs and the protocol.

See [Protocol Revenue](./protocol-revenue.md) for the complete fee distribution breakdown.

## Full Alignment Design

**Labs cannot win if the token holder does not win. The token holder cannot win if Labs does not win. Full alignment, by design.**

To be clear: this is not charity. Zenrock Labs is a for-profit business. But we understand a few things that many projects seem to have forgotten:

- *A thriving ecosystem benefits Labs far more than hoarding economics ever could.*
- *A rising token price is the most powerful tool in crypto: It attracts builders, users, partners, liquidity, attention. It creates a flywheel that no amount of offchain deal-making can replicate.*

When the token succeeds alongside the project, that's where true network effects are built. That's the system we designed.

# Offchain Revenues

When projects pretend their Labs does not need durable economics, one of three things happens:

- **Opaque cash sweeps:** quiet arrangements where money flows back to Labs through hidden mechanisms
- **Offchain deals that siphon value:** the classic "vampire economics" problem where usage and fees grow but the token does not benefit
- **Constant token selling:** creating perpetual sell pressure of the magnitude that has destroyed countless promising projects

This is why you see protocols with explosive usage paired with tokens that go nowhere. **The onchain story says one thing. The offchain arrangements say another.**

## Structural Commitment

Zenrock is structured differently. Labs receives its 35%, and in exchange, **Labs is structurally committed to routing all economic activity through the protocol.** This is a design principle, not merely a promise.

**If Labs signs an offchain agreement, all resulting economics are treated as protocol revenue and distributed through the same fee structure.**

There is no second business quietly capturing value outside the token:

- Offchain deals are structurally designed to benefit $ROCK holders
- As a $ROCK holder, you do not have to guess whether some unseen side deal is draining your upside
- You want Labs to pursue as many profitable offchain deals as possible, because all of that revenue flows through the protocol as if it originated onchain

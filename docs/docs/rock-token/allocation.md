# Token Allocation

## Fixed Supply

**Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 $ROCK**

There is no inflation mechanism. All rewards and incentives come from pre-allocated pools established at genesis. There is no mechanism to mint new tokens.

## Distribution

| Category | Allocation | Amount |
|----------|------------|--------|
| Team | 20.24% | 202,400,000 ROCK |
| Investors | 21.50% | 215,000,000 ROCK |
| Airdrop | 13.20% | 132,000,000 ROCK |
| Protocol Rewards | 15.00% | 150,000,000 ROCK |
| Ecosystem | 17.00% | 170,000,000 ROCK |
| Liquidity | 7.00% | 70,000,000 ROCK |
| Treasury | 6.06% | 60,600,000 ROCK |
| **Total** | **100.00%** | **1,000,000,000 ROCK** |

## Vesting Schedules

### Insiders (Team + Investors)

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Cliff | 12 months |
| Linear Vesting | 24 months after cliff |
| Total Vesting Period | 36 months |
| Start Date | November 11, 2024 |

Insiders (team and investors) are subject to a 12-month cliff followed by 24-month linear vesting. All vesting schedules began on November 11, 2024.

**Vesting Timeline**:
- **November 11, 2024**: Vesting begins, tokens locked
- **November 11, 2025**: Cliff ends, first tokens unlock
- **November 11, 2027**: Vesting complete

### Protocol Rewards (NRP)

Protocol rewards are distributed from the Node Reward Pool over 36 months per fee event. See [Staking](./staking.md) for the detailed vesting schedule.

The NRP receives:
- 8% of total supply at genesis (~61.8M ROCK) for baseline rewards
- 30% of all protocol fees for protocol rewards

### Other Categories

The remaining allocations (Airdrop, Ecosystem, Liquidity, Treasury) are managed according to their respective purposes to support ecosystem growth and operations.

## Alignment Through Vesting

The vesting structure ensures long-term alignment:

- **Team and investors** have a 36-month total vesting period, aligning their interests with long-term protocol success
- **Protocol rewards** vest over 36 months, creating sustained incentives for stakers
- **No immediate unlock** for insiders, preventing early sell pressure

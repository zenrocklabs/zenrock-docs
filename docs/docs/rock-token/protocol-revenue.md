# Protocol Revenue

**All Zenrock product fees flow through $ROCK. Here's how fees are structured across the ecosystem:**

**DCTs** (zenBTC, zenZEC, and future DCTs):

| Action | Fee |
| :---: | :---: |
| Mint | $5 flat |
| Redeem | 50bps |

**Hush:**

| Action | Fee |
| :---: | :---: |
| Shield | Free |
| Transfer | 0.01 JitoSOL |
| Unshield | 50bps |

All fees are converted to $ROCK and distributed according to Zenrock's tokenomic architecture (detailed in the next section). As more products launch and usage grows, protocol revenue scales accordingly.

zenBTC is Zenrock's flagship DCT: **decentralized yield-bearing wrapped Bitcoin on Solana.**

The underlying BTC is never lent out, levered up, or used as risk capital. There are no basis trades, no delta-neutral strategies, no opaque vaults, no dependencies on other firms. **Your BTC is in decentralized custody, designed for security.**

Most yield-bearing products rely on hidden strategies or unsustainable token emissions. zenBTC does neither. **Yield is funded by real protocol fees:** 5% of all zrChain fees flow to zenBTC, plus 35% of zenBTC custody fees directly.

Yield breakdown: [https://app.zenrocklabs.io/zenbtc/yield](https://app.zenrocklabs.io/zenbtc/yield)

Because zenBTC is permissionless to mint and redeem, yield is set by the market, not by marketing.

The yield rate is a function of two variables:

1. Total zenBTC supply
2. Total Zenrock protocol fees

As Zenrock earns more fees, yield rises. As yield rises, more users may choose to mint zenBTC to capture it, increasing supply and pushing yield back down. The cycle works in both directions: if yield falls too low, users redeem, supply decreases, and yield rises again.

**The result is a self-balancing mechanism that naturally discovers the market-clearing yield for low-risk BTC on Solana.** No governance votes, no manual rate setting, no emissions schedules. Just supply and demand.

And unlike most yield-bearing BTCs that pay in points or governance tokens, zenBTC yield is paid directly in sats on the Bitcoin blockchain, distributed daily.

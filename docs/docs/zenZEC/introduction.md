zenZEC is the second DCT: **decentralized wrapped Zcash on Solana.**

Zcash pioneered zero-knowledge proofs in cryptocurrency, enabling shielded transactions where the sender, receiver, and amount are encrypted. By bringing ZEC to Solana via the DCT standard, zenZEC inherits both Zcash's privacy heritage and Zenrock's decentralized custody guarantees.

### zrSign Version 1

In version 1, zrSign is deployed as a solidity smart contract on selected evm blockchains and receives key and signature requests. 
Destination blockchains can be specified through `CAIPs` and may require a custom relayer implementation to broadcast the transaction.

<!-- TODO: update zrSign contract addresses. -->

Currently supported networks in v1 are:

- [Ethereum Sepolia](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x8F309C9550D0d69C3f9b8d7BCdC7C93B05Cd089e)

More EVM chains will be announced soon!

### zrSign Version 2

In version 2, zrSign will be closely integrated with the Zenrock chain. Initially, it will support a small number of EVM chains. During the testnet phase, it will expand to include more networks such as other EVM chains, Bitcoin, Cosmos, and Solana, aligning with Zenrock's [omnichain vision](../../introduction.md#going-omnichain-with-zenrock).

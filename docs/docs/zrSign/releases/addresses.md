### zrSign Version 1

In version 1, zrSign is deployed as a solidity smart contract on selected evm blockchains and receives key and signature requests. 
Destination blockchains can be specified through `CAIPs` and may require a custom relayer implementation to broadcast the transaction.

<!-- TODO: update zrSign contract addresses. -->

Currently supported networks in v1 are:

- [Ethereum Sepolia](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x8F309C9550D0d69C3f9b8d7BCdC7C93B05Cd089e)

More EVM chains will be announced soon!

### zrSign Version 2

In version 2 with it beying closely entangled with Zenrock chain, zrSign will have only EVM support to begin with but will add more networks like more EVM chains, Bitcoin, Cosmos, and Solana to fulfill Zenrock's [omnichain vision](../../introduction.md#going-omnichain-with-zenrock) throughout testnet phase.

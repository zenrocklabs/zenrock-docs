LayerZero provides a solution for general message passing between custom smart contracts on different chains, called OApps. 
Such OApps can be used to forward key and signature requests from networks where zrSign is not deployed (yet) and bundle resources for zrSign-based cross-chain dapps. 

For further information on OApp implementation we can recommend the [LayerZero Docs](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/oapp/overview).

Zenrock Transfer Protocol (zenTP) enables native $ROCK transfers between zrChain (Cosmos) and Solana. Unlike traditional bridges that wrap tokens, zenTP represents $ROCK as a native SPL token on Solana, providing the same user experience as any native Solana asset.

200M $ROCK were transferred to Solana to seed liquidity as fully bridged, circulating tokens represented as a native SPL token. As users move tokens across the bridge, supply fluctuates on each side, but total supply remains unchanged.

zenTP is the first transfer protocol connecting Cosmos directly to Solana with native token representation (rather than wrapped tokens), leveraging zrChain's dMPC infrastructure for security.

# Decentralized Custody Tokens (DCTs)

A DCT is any token issued through Zenrock's decentralized custody network. Secured by dMPC and anchored by zrChain, DCTs set a new standard for cross-chain asset custody.

DCTs are more than wrappers. They're a security foundation. DeFi primitives can be built on top: structured products, leveraged vaults, restaking strategies. Developers take creative risks. Users choose their exposure. **The underlying custody stays the same.**

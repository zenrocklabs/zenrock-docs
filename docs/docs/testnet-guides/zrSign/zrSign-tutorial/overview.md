Welcome to the zrSign smart contract tutorial! This guide will walk you through the process of writing, explaining and deploying your own zrSign smart contract. 

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a fully functional zrSign implementation that allows you to create, verify, and manage MPC-generated keys and signatures for your use case. Whether you're building a decentralized application, enhancing document authenticity, or improving your blockchain-based identity system, this tutorial will equip you with the knowledge and skills to leverage zrSign effectively in your projects.

To get started, head to the [zrSign Hello World repository](https://github.com/zenrocklabs/zr-sign-hello-world/) and clone it on your machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zenrocklabs/zr-sign-hello-world.git
```

It is up to you to decide how you want to follow the tutorial. The contracts mentioned in the tutorial are already ready for deployment, however, it is very vanilla. You can extend the zrSignHelloWorld.sol contract to your needs and use the same deployment script to deploy your contract. 

The tutorial is structured as follows:

1. [Explanation of zrSignConnect.sol](./zrSignConnect.md)
2. [Explanation of zrSignHelloWorld.sol](./zrSign-hello-world.md)
3. [Build the zrSignHelloWorld contract step by step](./build-zrSign-hello-world.md)
4. [Deploy the zrSignHelloWorld contract](./deploy.md)
5. [Interact with your contract](./interact.md)
6. [Feedback](./feedback.md)

## Overview

The ZrSignHelloWorld contract is a simple implementation that extends the ZrSignConnect abstract contract. It serves as a basic example of how to use the ZrSignConnect functionality in a practical context.

## Key Features

1. **Message Signing**: Allows signing of arbitrary messages using an EVM wallet.
2. **Transaction Signing**: Enables the creation and signing of EVM transactions.

## Customization Potential

This contract is designed as a vanilla implementation that developers can easily customize to suit their specific needs. Its straightforward structure makes it an ideal starting point for building more complex applications that require secure signature management and cross-chain interactions.

By extending or modifying this contract, developers can:
- Implement custom logic for transaction creation
- Add specific business rules or constraints
- Integrate with other smart contracts or protocols

The ZrSignHelloWorld contract demonstrates the basic usage of ZrSignConnect, providing a foundation that can be tailored to a wide range of decentralized applications and use cases.

# What's Next

zrChain is live. zenBTC is minting. Hush is shielding.

Custody and privacy are just the beginning. As Zenrock Labs and other teams ship more products, all of it feeds the same tokenomics.

**Near-term focus areas include:**

* **Expanded DCT ecosystem:** Additional assets beyond BTC and ZEC
* **Hush applications:** DeFi primitives built on the shielded compute layer
* **Developer tooling:** Infrastructure to accelerate third-party building
* **Protocol upgrades:** Continued expansion of dMPC operator set and security guarantees

Expect continued shipping.

**More products. More fees. More value to $ROCK.**

**Get started:** [https://www.zenrocklabs.io/](https://www.zenrocklabs.io/)

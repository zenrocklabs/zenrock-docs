# Build on zrChain

**Anyone can build on Zenrock and earn a share of what they generate, subject to Zenrock tokenomics.**

## Integration Paths

### Create a New DCT

For teams with existing assets seeking decentralized custody on Solana:

- Bring any token to Solana with institutional-grade security through dMPC custody
- Requires asset specification and outpost infrastructure coordination
- Subject to protocol governance approval

See [DCT Framework](../DCT/dct-introduction.md) for technical details on the Decentralized Custody Token standard.

### Build on Existing DCTs

For DeFi protocols, yield strategies, and structured products:

- Use zenBTC, zenZEC, or future DCTs as primitives
- Build lending protocols, structured products, vaults, and other DeFi applications
- Inherit zrChain's security guarantees

Resources:
- [zenBTC Technical Architecture](../zenBTC/zenbtc-technical.md)
- [zenZEC Technical Architecture](../zenZEC/zenzec-technical.md)

### Build on Hush Protocol

For privacy-focused applications and private payments:

- Leverage the shielded compute layer for confidential DeFi
- Build private lending, private trading, anonymous payments
- Access Miden STARK zero-knowledge infrastructure

See [Hush Protocol](../Hush/hush-introduction.md) for privacy layer documentation.

### Build Something New

The dMPC infrastructure is general-purpose. Novel use cases include:

- Identity systems
- Key management solutions
- Cross-chain messaging
- Custody-as-a-service integrations

**The infrastructure is live and extensible.**

## Revenue Share

**Builders earn 30% of all fees their products generate**, distributed in $ROCK according to protocol tokenomics.

In instances where multiple teams contribute to a product, revenue allocation is configured at the protocol level.

See [Protocol Revenue](../rock-token/protocol-revenue.md) for the complete fee distribution breakdown.

## Builder Support

Zenrock supports builders with:

- **Marketing and awareness** - Co-marketing opportunities and ecosystem visibility
- **Compliance support** - Guidance on regulatory considerations
- **Go-to-market strategy** - Launch planning and user acquisition
- **Technical integration** - Engineering support and documentation

We want you to succeed because when you succeed, the whole ecosystem benefits.

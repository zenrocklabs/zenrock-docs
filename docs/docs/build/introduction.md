# Build on zrChain

**Anyone can build on Zenrock and earn a share of what they generate, subject to Zenrock tokenomics.**

## Integration Paths

**Create a New DCT**

For teams with existing assets seeking decentralized custody on Solana. Bring any token to Solana with institutional-grade security through dMPC custody. Requires asset specification, outpost infrastructure coordination, and protocol governance approval.

**Build on Existing DCTs**

For DeFi protocols, yield strategies, and structured products. Use zenBTC, zenZEC, or future DCTs as primitives for lending, structured products, vaults, and other DeFi applications.

**Build on Hush Protocol**

For privacy-focused applications and private payments. Leverage the shielded compute layer to build confidential DeFi: private lending, private trading, anonymous payments.

**Build Something New**

The dMPC infrastructure is general-purpose. Identity systems, key management, cross-chain messaging: the infrastructure is live and extensible.

## Revenue Share

**Builders have the ability to receive, or direct the distribution of 30% of all fees their products generate, distributed in $ROCK according to protocol tokenomics. In instances where multiple teams contribute to a product, revenue can be configured at the protocol level.**

## Builder Support

**Zenrock Foundation and Zenrock Labs support builders with marketing, compliance support, go-to-market strategy, and technical integration.** We want you to succeed because when you succeed, the whole ecosystem benefits.
